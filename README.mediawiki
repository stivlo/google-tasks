= Google Tasks =

Playing with Google Tasks API, at the moment I've implemented OAuth 2.

To configure the application, copy src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/app-config-template.xml
to src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/app-config.xml and customize Google API Client Id,
Google API Secret and callback URL within the application pointing to
<app-context>/auth-response.

Build with maven from command line or using m2eclipse plugin.
